# Introduction to Urban Exploring

## Aquiring Gear

There are many things you want to bring with you while Urban Exploring. For starters, you want a *backpack* 
to carry all of your gear, a _flashlight_ to see your way through dark areas, and a *camera* to capture all of your findings.

**TIP**: **NEVER EXPLORE AT NIGHT**

**_Never_** Tresspass if you see **No Tresspassing Signs**

Leave footprints but ~~take nothing~~.
