> Proper gear is crucial when exploring. It could be what does or doens't cause a situation or what gets you out of it. If you buy cheap gear, chances of getting hurt are increased. Do yourself the favor of saving up a little more for the more expensive stuff to stay as safe as you can.

The more cooperative you are with police, the nicer they usually will be. 

A way in and out is smart because if anything starts to happen, you know exactly where to go. 

Info on the property owner can tell you many things such as their history and how they might feel about you there.
Parking in front of a building will be an automatic give away.
